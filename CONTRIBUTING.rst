BUGS
====

All bugs must be submitted through launchpad.  If code is posted without a
reference to a bug or blueprint, you will be asked to do so.

Please visit our luanchpad project to open a bug: https://launchpad.net/neutron-quark


BLUEPRINTS & FEATURES
=====================

If you are submitting a new feature, please open a blueprint prior to submitting
code.  The blueprint must detail the following information:

1. Purpose of the Feature
2. Overview of Implementation

Please visit our launchpad project to open a blueprint: https://launchpad.net/neutron-quark


REQUEST FOR FEATURES
====================

It is possible to request for features from our team without being a part of
the actual code implementation.  Please submit through our launcpad project
and detail as much of the requirement as possible.

We will review and determine if it is possible and when a developer can be
assigned to the request.
